  <h1>Privacy Policy for Draema App</h1>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the Draema mobile application (the "App") that generates movie-like comics from text using generative AI.</p>

  <p>When you use the Draema App, we collect information you provide directly to us, such as the text input you enter into the application. This text may include personal information depending on what you choose to input. We do not collect any other personal information automatically.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the information you provide from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
